# Project Fixes Applied - NAZ Engineering Website

## Overview
This document lists all the errors and issues that were identified and resolved in the NAZ Engineering Website project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Version Conflicts
**Issue**: React types dependency conflict between devDependencies and overrides
- `@types/react` was `^19` in devDependencies but `^19.1.10` in overrides
- `@types/react-dom` was `^19` in devDependencies but `^19.1.7` in overrides

**Fix**: Updated devDependencies to match overrides versions:
```json
"@types/react": "^19.1.10",
"@types/react-dom": "^19.1.7"
```

### 2. Unstable Dependency Version
**Issue**: Using "latest" for `@supabase/supabase-js` which can cause unpredictable behavior
```json
"@supabase/supabase-js": "latest"
```

**Fix**: Fixed to specific version:
```json
"@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.52.0"
```

### 3. Missing CSS Import
**Issue**: Global CSS not imported in layout.tsx

**Fix**: Added CSS import:
```tsx
import "./globals.css"
```

### 4. Incorrect Layout Structure
**Issue**: Layout was configured as a client component (`'use client'`) while also trying to export metadata

**Fix**: 
- Removed `'use client'` directive from layout.tsx
- Properly imported and exported metadata from metadata.ts
- Converted to server component for better SEO and performance

### 5. Dynamic Import SSR Issues
**Issue**: Client-side components using `ssr: false` in server components causing build errors

**Fix**: 
- Created `components/client-components.tsx` as a client component wrapper
- Moved all client-side dynamic imports to the client wrapper
- Updated layout to properly import client-side components

### 6. Missing Navigation Component
**Issue**: Navigation component was commented out and not being rendered

**Fix**: 
- Added proper dynamic import for Navigation component
- Enabled all necessary components in layout (Navigation, ResourcePrefetcher, ScrollToTop, WhatsAppFloat, WebVitals)
- Ensured proper server vs client component separation

### 7. Cross-Platform Script Issues
**Issue**: Cleanup scripts in package.json used Unix commands that don't work on Windows

**Fix**: 
- Added `rimraf` as dev dependency for cross-platform file deletion
- Updated scripts to use rimraf:
```json
"clean": "rimraf .next out node_modules/.cache .turbo",
"clean:full": "rimraf .next out node_modules package-lock.json .turbo && npm install"
```

## Project Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: All critical errors and issues have been fixed
✅ **TESTED**: All major functionality verified
✅ **OPTIMIZED**: Performance optimizations preserved
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Environment variables documented

## Environment Setup Required

Users need to configure their own Supabase credentials by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and updating with their actual values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with real Supabase project credentials.

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run Linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Type Checking**:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

## Additional Optimizations Applied

- Proper metadata handling for SEO
- Server-side component optimization
- Cross-platform script compatibility
- Dependency version stability
- Build performance optimizations

## Technical Stack Verified

- ✅ Next.js 15.4.6
- ✅ React 19.1.1
- ✅ TypeScript 5
- ✅ TailwindCSS 4.1.9
- ✅ Supabase 2.52.0
- ✅ All UI Components (Radix UI)
- ✅ Form handling (React Hook Form + Zod)
- ✅ Performance monitoring tools

The project is now ready for development and deployment with all critical issues resolved.
